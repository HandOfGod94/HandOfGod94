## Hi there 👋

Polyglot programmer, trying out every new shiny thing :) 

- 🔭 I’m currently working on
  - [unmixtape](https://unmixtape.roadmap-ai.tech)
    - Web app, providing a way to customize your spotify recommendations
  - [Moonshi](https://moonshi.roadmap-ai.tech)
    - Recurring expense trackr
  - [JobTrackr](https://jobtrackr.roadmap-ai.tech)
    - A personal no non-sense job trackr. 

- 🌱 I’m currently learning
  - Learning awesome [gleamlang](https://github.com/gleam-lang/gleam)
  - Getting hands dirty in langchain and AI space (`#fomo`)
  - Exploring low-code space, trying out few things in supabase, pocketbase, appwrite. So far, somewhat happy with pocketbase for personal projects
- ⚡ Fun fact:  
		My past jobs gave me opportunities to work on variety of stacks. Few of the interesting ones 
  - Phoenix (Elixir), Clojure, go, ruby @ [gojek](https://www.gojek.io/)
  - ruby, react-native @ [jiva.ag](https://www.jiva.ag/)
  - vert.x, node.ja @ [rapido](https://rapido.bike)
  - Personally I have explored lots of languages, 
      - obvious ones: python, dart, lua, rust
      - few of the interesting ones: janet, fennel

> Why? I don't intend to be proficient in all of these langauges, but learning these
		does open up perspectives on how things could be modeled in different paradigms, with different
		ways of thinking
